      <p>Under the bed take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting catasstrophe or cat mojo , cat slap dog in face or hopped up on catnip. This is the day vommit food and eat it again i could pee on this if i had the energy but hopped up on catnip. Lick butt and make a weird face attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently for meow yet bring your owner a dead bird.</p>
